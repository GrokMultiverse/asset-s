  "description": "This is the official Genesis Testing NFT for the GrokMultiverse ecosystem, deployed exclusively on the Solana Devnet. This asset is strictly for protocol validation and system stress-testing purposes. Limited Issuance: This is a one-time mint assigned to authorized testers only. Non-Transferable: This NFT is bound to the original minter's wallet and cannot be sold or traded on secondary markets. Zero Commercial Value: As a Devnet-only asset, it holds no monetary value and serves solely as a Proof of Testing certificate. Purpose: It verifies the holder's participation in the Phase 1 architectural setup of GrokMultiverse. This NFT ensures that the smart contract's minting logic, metadata URI resolution, and wallet-binding features are functioning correctly before the Mainnet transition.",
